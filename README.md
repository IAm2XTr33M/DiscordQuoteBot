# DiscordQuoteBot
A python bot for discord.

I wanted to learn how to make a discord bot, so I ended up making a bot where you can create quotes (that you or your friends would say)
And where you can read all quotes of a specific person, or read specific quotes, I also made it save the time of when that person made the quote. + I coded it so you are able to have a different prefix in every server.
